## Introduction

Overview of the Project

In today's fast-paced financial markets, the ability to make informed decisions swiftly is crucial for success. The project aims to address this need by developing a Real-Time Financial Analysis & Trading System. This system will empower users, particularly students, to construct a scalable, distributed platform capable of processing and analyzing simulated financial data in real-time. By leveraging distributed computing principles, microservices architecture, and stream processing techniques, the system will generate actionable trading signals, providing users with valuable insights into market trends and opportunities.

The primary objective of this project is to construct a robust system that can efficiently handle the complexities of financial data analysis and trading signal generation. By working with simulated financial data, participants will gain hands-on experience in analyzing various fields such as stock symbols, opening prices, and more. The system will compute and visualize essential trading indicators on a user-friendly dashboard, enabling users to interpret stock performance easily and make well-informed trading decisions.

The scope of the project encompasses the development of several key components, including data ingestion, stream processing, signal generation, data visualization, and notification services. These components will work in tandem to process incoming data, analyze market trends, and generate timely trading signals. Additionally, the project emphasizes the use of microservices architecture and websockets to ensure scalability, real-time data processing, and seamless user interaction.

Through a carefully designed architecture and a technology stack that supports scalability and real-time processing, the project aims to provide users with a comprehensive platform for financial analysis and trading. By simulating real-world market conditions and employing advanced analytical techniques, the system will offer users a valuable learning experience in the field of financial markets and algorithmic trading.

Overall, the Real-Time Financial Analysis & Trading System represents an exciting opportunity for participants to develop practical skills in financial data analysis, software architecture, and distributed computing. By leveraging modern technologies and industry best practices, the project aims to empower users to make informed trading decisions in today's dynamic financial landscape.
